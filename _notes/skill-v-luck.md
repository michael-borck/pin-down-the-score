Several studies have investigated the balance between skill and luck in competitive sports. Levitt & Miles (2012) examined the World Series of Poker and found that highly skilled players achieved significantly higher returns on investment compared to others, highlighting the impact of skill in such competitions (Levitt & Miles, 2012). Additionally, focused on Fantasy Premier League and determined that skill played a more crucial role than luck in the outcomes of the games (O'Brien, 2020). These findings underscore the significance of skill in certain competitive sports settings.

Moreover, Formenti et al. (2020) explored how volleyball-specific skills and cognitive functions can differentiate players of varying competitive levels, indicating the importance of cognitive abilities in sports performance (Formenti et al., 2020; . Wang et al., 2013) demonstrated that athletes exhibit superior inhibitory control, suggesting a link between cognitive functions and success in sports (Wang et al., 2013). These studies emphasize the role of cognitive skills in enhancing athletic performance.

Furthermore, Rosenbusch et al. (2020) simulated the reliability of outcomes in battle royale games, highlighting the negative perception of high luck involvement in competitive sports and e-sports tournaments (Rosenbusch et al., 2020). This negative view of luck in competitive settings is echoed in 's work (2015), which posits that sports competitions are primarily designed to assess competitors' skills rather than luck (Loland, 2015).

In conclusion, the interplay between skill and luck in competitive sports is a multifaceted topic that has been explored through various lenses. While luck may have a presence in sports, studies consistently emphasize the pivotal role of skill in determining success in competitive athletic endeavors.
