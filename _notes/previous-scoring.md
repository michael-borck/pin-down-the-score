Several studies have explored different aspects of ten-pin bowling scoring systems, ranging from technological advancements to statistical analysis of scores and evaluation of handicapping systems. For instance, VanDerwerken and Kenter (2018) developed a Markov model for generating ten-pin bowling scores, providing a sophisticated method for in-game prediction and player comparison beyond raw scores. This approach contributes to understanding scoring dynamics and player performance in professional bowling ([VanDerwerken & Kenter, 2018](https://typeset.io/papers/a-generative-markov-model-for-bowling-scores-1sutqgkwej)).
