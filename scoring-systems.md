Scoring systems play a crucial role in ensuring fair and objective competition in sports. Ferreira (2018) emphasizes the need for a balance between promptness and meaningful performance evaluation in scoring systems, particularly in search and rescue competitions. Csat'o (2021) further explores this balance, comparing different scoring rules in the context of Formula One World Championship to find an optimal set of point values. Amoroso (2023) highlights the role of self-refereeing and the spirit of the game in promoting fair play in Ultimate, suggesting that understanding the meaning of scores can lead to constructive reflection and improvement. These studies collectively underscore the importance of scoring systems in maintaining fairness and objectivity in sports competitions.

The design of scoring systems is not easy. The paper discusses the importance of
designing scoring systems tailored to different types of competitions, balancing
promptness in judging with meaningful performance evaluation, with a focus on
search and rescue competitions. The methodology involves presenting and
comparing several approaches to scoring in search and rescue competitions,
followed by a critical analysis and comparative discussion of each approach.


A comparative study of scoring systems by simulations

The current scoring scheme seems to be a reasonable compromise close to the
Pareto frontier. The paper discusses the trade-off between early clinch and
winning without finishing first in sports competitions, provides a methodology
for choosing scoring rules, compares historical and geometric scoring systems,
and concludes that the current Formula One system is a good compromise. The
methodology involves simulating different points scoring systems using
historical Formula One World Championship results, repeating the simulation
process 100 thousand times independently for each simulation. Two sets of years
are studied: a standard dataset covering seasons between 2010 and 2019, and a
small margin dataset covering specific seasons. The study aims to maximize the
probability of winning without finishing first by assuming a risk-averse
scenario for the original world champion. The robustness of the simulations can
be improved by considering other datasets.


Self-Refereeing System in Ultimate during the Joint Junior Ultimate Championship in Three Different Divisionsâ€”A Different Way to Promote Fair-Play?

The scores from the individual criteria correlated well with the overall scores
of the WFDF Joint Junior Ultimate Championship. The paper discusses the
importance of self-refereeing in sports, particularly in ultimate, to promote
fair play and sportsmanship through the Spirit of the Game (SOTG) scoring
system, aiming to educate players and celebrate teams with the highest scores.
The methodology involved a retrospective team sports study design, data
collection from players attending the JJUC 2022, SOTG scoring system based on a
5-point Likert scale, and statistical analysis including various tests and
correlations.
